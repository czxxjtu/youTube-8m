#Searchkit
Searchkit is a suite of UI components built in react. The aim is to easily create search applications in ElasticSearch. Full documentation can be found [here](http://docs.searchkit.co/stable/index.html).
Our group decided to use Searchkit for the following reasons.
* Reason 1
* Reason 2
* Reason 3

##1. Project Setup
###Installing via NPM
####Download Node.js
Download Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine, and you can download it [here](https://nodejs.org/en/)
I downloaded v6.9.1 LTS, recommended for most users.
Test it if you've got the node installed correctly on your computer.
To see if Node is installed, type `node -v` on your command line.
```
v6.9.1
```
To see if npm is installed, type `npm -v` on your command line.
```
3.10.8
```
####Install searchkit
```
$ npm install searchkit
```
If you run into any trouble find answers [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/searchkit/tutorial)

##2. Connecting to Elasticsearch instance
###Using local ES Server
Initially I set searchkit up on my local machine. 


###Using cloud
